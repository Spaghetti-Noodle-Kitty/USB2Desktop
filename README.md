# USB2Desktop
## What does this program do?
> USB-2-Desktop is an application, that listens to your USB-Mount actions.
> This means, that it can detect if you plug a new USB-drive into your PC or if you pull a USB-drive out of it.
>  
> If a new USB-drive gets plugged in, USB-2-Desktop will create a shortcut to it on your desktop.
> If you unplug the same USB-drive, USB-2-Desktop will remove said shortcut from the desktop.

## Why did you make this?
> First off, because I was bored and needed a project to work on.
> Additionaly I always liked the way many Linux devices handled USB-drives and their mounting on the desktop.

## Can I use the code here myself?
> Yes, yes you can! You are free to use all of the code in here as long as you use it to create or expand your
> own project.
